## Development Process and Project Management


- We started the website the 10/05/2023 with my classmate Maiana,
- Figma design : Maiana started by designing an MVP of our website. It was mainly inspired by the Yu-Gi-Oh, official website as we wanted to keep the brand colors,
- Once the design finished, we identified the pages and components and decided to divide up the tasks,
- First, we made a first version of the site with just html and css to add to pages conponents we created,
- After, we join pages by routes and create a little collection of cards on Postman, 
- To keep track of our work, we we had daily meeting to share and update our ToDo List on Notion,
- For the bonus, we create a page where users can create their own card and display it in the collection


## Design Consideration

- After completing the main functionalities, we focused on enhancing the site's visual appeal through CSS styling.
- We decided to maintain the design elements of the Yu-Gi-Oh universe by incorporating dark colors and game-related images.


## Mistakes

- One of our biggest challenges was with class naming. When someone needed to work on another person's component, it was sometimes difficult to understand and locate the specific component.

## Improvements

- In the future, we plan to enhance the card creation feature and add additional pages such as a page for comparing card strengths and creating a full deck.
